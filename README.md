# Nuked SC-55 CLAP audio plug-in

The Nuked SC-55 CLAP audio plug-in ([CLAP](https://cleveraudio.org/)) is built upon [J.C. Moyer's fork](https://github.com/jcmoyer/Nuked-SC55) of nukeykt's original [Nuked SC-55](https://github.com/nukeykt/Nuked-SC55) project.

Contrary to the original Nuked-SC55 this plugin is based on, Nuked SC-55 CLAP has no graphical user interface. The plugin only reacts to MIDI messages, just like an external MIDI module without a display (e.g., the [Roland SC-55ST](https://www.synthark.org/Roland/SC-55ST.html)). Future versions might include the emulation of the original hardware's LCD display or even a full custom GUI.

The plug-in aims to preserve an important part of DOS gaming history for all to freely enjoy for posterity. It is only intended for **personal use** (e.g., retro gaming or writing music as a hobby) and **research purposes**. See the [License](#license) section for additional details.

## Installation

Download the latest version for your operating system from the [releases page](https://github.com/johnnovak/Nuked-SC55-CLAP/releases) page, then unzip it into one of these OS-specific locations:

- **Windows**

  - `C:\Program Files\Common Files\CLAP\`
  - `$LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\CLAP\`

- **macOS**

  - `/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/CLAP/`
  - `$HOME/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/CLAP/`

- **Linux**

  - `/usr/lib/clap/`
  - `$HOME/.clap/`

### macOS Gatekeeper

If macOS Gatekeeper prevents the plug-in from running, you will need to explicitly whitelist it with the following command from the terminal (replace `<path-to>` with the actual path to `Nuked-SC55.clap`):

```zsh
sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine <path-to>/Nuked-SC55.clap
```

### ROM files

The emulation needs dumps of the original hardware's ROM chips to function. If any of the ROM files for a given model are not present or they are invalid, you will not be able to load the plugin for that particular model. It is the easiest to grab the ROM files from [here](https://archive.org/details/nuked-sc-55-clap-rom-files), but here are the instructions how to set them up if you are getting them from elsewhere.

Create a `Nuked-SC55-Resources` directory in the folder where the CLAP plugin resides with a `ROMs` folder in it. Finally, create subfolders inside the `ROMs` folder for the different models with specific names (e.g., `SC-55-v1.20`).

This is how the folder structure should look:

```text
Nuked-SC55-Resources
  ROMs
    SC-55-v1.00
	  ...

    SC-55-v1.20
      sc55_rom1.bin
      sc55_rom2.bin
      sc55_waverom1.bin
      sc55_waverom2.bin
      sc55_waverom3.bin

    SC-55-v1.21
	  ...

    SC-55-v2.00
	  ...

    SC-55mk2-v1.01
	  ...
```

On macOS, you can also put the `ROMs` folder in the `Resources` folder inside the `Nuked-SC55.clap` application bundle.

As an alternative to creating the `Nuked-SC55-Resources` directory in the plugin location, you may set the `SOUNDCANVAS_ROM_DIR` environment variable to a list of absolute directories of where to look for ROM's. The OS PATH separator is used as a list delimiter Eg:

```pwsh
$Env:SOUNDCANVAS_ROM_DIR = "C:\path\to\ROM\dir"
```
```pwsh
$Env:SOUNDCANVAS_ROM_DIR = "C:\path\to\ROM\dir;Z:\alt\path\to\dir"
```

or

```sh
export SOUNDCANVAS_ROM_DIR=/path/to/ROM/dir
```
```sh
export SOUNDCANVAS_ROM_DIR=/path/to/ROM/dir:/alt/path/to/rom/dir
```

Here is the list of required files for each supported model and their SHA1 hashes. Lookup is performed by filename, so make sure the names match exactly.

## Building

The main build method is via CMake and vcpkg. This is what the CI workflow uses.

On Linux you can also build without vcpkg, using [system libraries](#using-system-libs-on-linux-alternative-build-method).

### Prerequisites

#### All platforms

- CMake (3.27.0 or later)
- vcpkg (latest)

#### Windows

- Visual Studio 2022 (17.11.0 or later)

#### macOS or Linux

- Clang (16.0.0 or later)
- Ninja (1.12.0 or later)

### Installing vcpkg

If you don't have vcpkg installed yet:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
cd vcpkg && bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
```

Then append this to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

```bash
export VCPKG_ROOT=<vcpkg_repo_location>
export PATH=$VCPKG_ROOT:$PATH
```

On Windows, run `bootstrap-vcpkg.bat` instead and set the `PATH` Windows enviroment variable accordingly:

```pwsh
$env:VCPKG_ROOT="<vcpkg_repo_location>"
$env:PATH="$env:VCPKG_ROOT;$env:PATH"
```

### Building the project

#### Windows

First you'll need to configure the project:

```pwsh
cmake --preset debug-windows-x64
```

Then build the **debug artifact** (this will create the `Nuked-SC55.clap` plugin in `build\debug-windows-x64`):

```pwsh
cmake --build --preset debug-windows-x64
```

To configure and build the **release artifact** (this will create the `Nuked-SC55.clap` plugin in `build\release-windows-x64`):

```pwsh
cmake --preset release-windows-x64
cmake --build --preset release-windows-x64
```

The `msvc-sanitizer` preset is also available for debugging.

#### macOS

Run [`build-macos.sh`](build-macos.sh) to create the universal binary app bundle in the `out` directory. Alternatively, follow the manual steps below.

First you'll need to configure the project. Use the corresponding command to configure the debug or release build:

```zsh
cmake --preset debug-macos-arm64
cmake --preset release-macos-arm64
```

To cross-compile, (e.g., for x86_64):

```zsh
cmake --preset debug-macos-x64
cmake --preset release-macos-x64
```

To build the project (use the same preset):

```zsh
cmake --build --preset <preset-used-to-configure>
```

This will create the `Nuked-SC55.clap` app bundle in the `build/<preset>` directory.

The `clang-sanitizer` preset is also available for debugging.

#### Linux

First you'll need to configure the project. Use the corresponding command to configure the debug or release build:

```zsh
cmake --preset debug-linux-x64
cmake --preset release-linux-x64
```

To build the project (use the same preset):

```zsh
cmake --build --preset <preset-used-to-configure>
```

This will create the `Nuked-SC55.clap` plug-in in the `build/<preset>` directory.

The following presets are also available for debugging:

- `gcc-sanitizer`
- `clang-sanitizer`

#### Using system libs on Linux (alternative build method)

On Linux it is possible to compile using system libraries, without using vcpkg.
Prerequisites are now different:

- Clang (16.0.0 or later)
- Ninja (1.12.0 or later)
- SpeexDSP (1.2.1 or later)

To configure the project, use one of the `syslibs` presets:

```zsh
cmake --preset debug-linux-syslibs-x64
cmake --preset release-syslibs-linux-x64
```

Build the project as normal.

The following presets are also available for debugging:

- `gcc-sanitizer-syslibs`
- `clang-sanitizer-syslibs`

### Cleaning the build directory

To clean the `build/<preset>` directory (e.g., for MSVC):

```bash
cmake --build --preset release-windows-x64 --target clean
```

To start from scratch, delete the `build` directory and run the configure commands again.
